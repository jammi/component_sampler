  <p>HSlider is a control unit that enables the user to choose a value in a range of values. Sliders support both dragging the handle and clicking the mouse anywhere on the slider to move the handle towards the mouse, as well as keyboard support after the handle is in active mode. There are two types of sliders: vertical and horizontal. Naturally, sliders are commonly used as colour mixers, volume controls, graphical equalizers and seekers in media applications. A typical slider is a drag-able thumb along vertical or horizontal line.</p>
