  <p>HSheet is a container component that toggles its visibility based on its value. When the value is 0, it's visible, otherwise it's hidden. It expands to fill its parent view, the rect specifies the size of the sheet inside. The sheet is centered. It's practical when combined with button values. Also see HAlertSheet and HConfirmSheet components.</p>
